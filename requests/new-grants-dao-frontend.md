## New grantsDAO frontend
 
We're looking for someone to build a new frontend for the Synthetix grantsDAO. 

## Additional information: 
The intention behind the new frontend is to provide visitors with a clear summary of what the grantsDAO has currently funded and wants to fund. 

Stylistically, it would be great to have it as close to the [current SIPs site](https://sips.synthetix.io/) as possible, with one tab for proposals and one for requests. 

We will also implement a format to all current grantsDAO proposals and requests that allows them to be sorted in Markdown according to their status, also displaying number, title, and name. For proposals:  
- Proposed (flagged if still in voting period)
- Approved
- Completed
- Rejected

And for requests: 
- Proposed
- Completed
- Deprecated

One other thing that would be great would be if it also served as the UI for the grantsDAO members, allowing them to connect via Metamask and interact with the grantsDAO contract. 

All assets of this request can be discussed personally with the grantsDAO if you're thinking of proposing to build it. 

The contract is deployed at [0x86626E1BbBd0ce95ED52e0C5E19f371a6640B591](https://etherscan.io/address/0x86626e1bbbd0ce95ed52e0c5e19f371a6640b591#code)
And it can also be accessed at https://etherscan.io/address/grantsdao.snx.eth 

## For respondents to the request (Do not edit)
Proposals should follow the proposal template available in the /proposals folder.
