## Title of proposal: 
A bot to help users with frequently asked questions 

## Description: 
We have many question repeated many, many times by users in discord. Our tireless guardians do their best to patiently answer them, but they could use some help. Enter FAQ bot.

## Motivation: 
The idea is to build the bot by assembling all common questions&answers already available on official and community synthetix pages.
Additionally, I would build a framework for anyone to add more questions&answers with git PRs.

## Additional information: 
1. The bot would only give anwers in DM as to not be abused and spam other channels
2. If summoned with "!faq" in a channel, the bot would kindly ask the user to take their questions to DM
3. The bot will have a command to give a list of all known categories with questions
4. The bot will be able to list all questions per category
5. The bot will be able to answer a predefined question with discord embeds to support rich text answers and pretty print
6. The bot will also be able to answer questions such as: current gas/minting price, rewards, liquidity pools, etc...
7. The bot will provide a search feature for users to search known questions&answers by keyword
