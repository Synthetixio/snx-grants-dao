## Title of proposal: 
Mintr Debt Analytics

## Description: 
Add Debt Tracking/Analytics to Mintr.

Help minters understand their debt by isolating mints and burns from the on-chain debt. 
This will give a good idea to the minter on how the debt pool fluctuates.

E.g. : 
I mint 100 sUSD and burn 50 sUSD. A day later my debt is at 52 sUSD. 
This would mean that the debt pool has fluctuated by 2 sUSD against the minter. 
The goal is to help minters visualize this information at any point in time.

## Motivation: 
It is currently very hard to minters to understand their debt. 

## Additional information: 
Check out this demo @ defisnap.io/#/kain.

## Previous work: 
defisnap.io

## Estimated hours: 
To date: 14 hours already put in
I would need to evaluate Mintr a bit more to understand how much time it can take to implement.

## Price (SNX):
To be determined, I rarely do hourly rates.
I have access to archive node that I can lend out as well.
