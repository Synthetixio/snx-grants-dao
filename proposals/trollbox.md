# Synthetix Trollbox

## Description: 
The Synthetix Trollbox is a 3box (https://www.3box.io/) powered, social trading platform designed to increase community engagement and grow the Synthetix user base. This platform will allow users to:
  - trade synths
  - get a live stream of trades and post comments on trading activity
  - publicly share thoughts on the various synths available
  - message each other in the app
  - all of this happens while the user retains full control over their own data and privacy settings

## Motivation: 
The motivation for this project is to increase engagement of users with the Synthetix protocol. The goal is for traders to actively engage with the platform and invite new users through social sharing features. Using the tools provided by 3box, we can make the Synthetix protocol go viral!  

## Additional information: 
- The project will be built using the 3box products for messaging, storage and profiles: https://www.3box.io/products
- There are 4 layers of work to this project and I welcome other contributors to help me with all or any of these aspects
    1. researching the 3box tools and implementing them into the codebase
    2. creating an intelligent, well-researched design to suit user needs
        -  Note there will likely be a complete redesign after the initial product release, once there are more users and better feedback around how people are using or would like to use the trollbox.
    3. scoping the development into chunks of work based on a better understanding of 1 and 2
    4. implementing the user interface in react

## Previous work: 
I have done and will continue to do significant work on the Synthetix Dashboard, which is now open source after my recent changes:
-  https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-dashboard
- I am also starting to work on the Synthetix subgraph and while I don't have a PR up for it yet, you can see my first bit of work here: https://github.com/dvd-schwrtz/synthetix-subgraph/commit/e848dabb590a4fdd37bbb7976be107340c3dbe39

## Estimated hours: 
e.g. 
- 16 hours initial technical planning and research
- 16 hours initial design research
- xx hours building

Since there are many features that will be developed over time and it will take some time and effort to research the best way to break the project into chunks of work, it is hard to provide an exact estimate for finishing the trollbox or developing the initial version; however, 3box well designed API makes it an approachable task for a single individual in a reasonable time frame. Therefore, I propose to track my individual hours and received payment for work done every 2 months. I am committed to finish building the platform, and I will be expedient with my time as I have been with the Dashboard and working on the Graph.

## Price (SNX): 
- Hourly rate of 60 SNX tokens for the duration of the project. 
    NOTE: we can change the hourly rate after 300 hours are billed if the token has decreased or increased in value and there is significant more work required, such as a major redesign due to popular demand.
- Payment terms: every 2 months with 2400 SNX up front to cover the initial 40 hours of work
