## Title of proposal: 
Mintr Debt Analytics

## Description: 
Add Debt Tracking/Analytics to Mintr.

Help minters understand their debt by isolating mints and burns from the on-chain debt. 
This will give a good idea to the minter on how the debt pool fluctuates.

E.g.: 
I mint 100 sUSD and burn 50 sUSD. A day later my debt is at 52 sUSD. 
This would mean that the debt pool has fluctuated by 2 sUSD against me. 
The goal is to help minters visualize this information at any point in time.

## Motivation: 
It is currently very hard for minters to understand their debt. 

## Additional information: 
Check out this demo -> defisnap.io/#/kain. 

It shows two charts with the gross debt(mint and burn debt), actual debt(on-chain debt) and net debt(isolated debt).

- The first chart has the gross debt applied retroactively (from present debt)
- The second chart has the gross debt applied from the first mint and burn event.

## Previous work: 
defisnap.io

## Estimated hours: 
- To date: 12 hours already put in
I would need to evaluate Mintr a bit more to understand how much time it can take to implement.

## Price (SNX):
To be determined.
I have access to archive node that I can lend out as well.
